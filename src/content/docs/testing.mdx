# Testing your application

## Used libraries

RSK comes with the following libraries for testing purposes:

- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) - JavaScript testing library
- [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) - Testing utilities for React

You may also want to take a look at the following related packages:

- [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom)
- [react-addons-test-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-addons-test-utils)

## Running tests

To test your application simply run `yarn test` which will:

- recursively find all files ending with `.test.js` in your `src/` directory

```bash
yarn test
```

## Conventions

- test filenames MUST end with `test.js` or `yarn test` will not be able to
  detect them
- test filenames SHOULD be named after the related component (e.g. create
  `Login.test.js` for `Login.js` component)

## Basic example
See the Layou
[basic test case](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/blob/master/src/components/Layout/Layout.test.js)
to use as a starting point:

```js
import React from 'react';
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
import App from '../App';
import Layout from './Layout';

describe('Layout', () => {
  test('renders children correctly', () => {
    const wrapper = renderer
      .create(
        <App context={{ insertCss: () => {}, fetch: () => {}, pathname: '' }}>
          <Layout>
            <div className="child" />
          </Layout>
        </App>,
      )
      .toJSON();

    expect(wrapper).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

## Linting

In order to check if your JavaScript and CSS code follows the suggested style
guidelines run:

```bash
yarn run lint
```
export const metadata = {
  title: 'Testing',
  fileName:'testing',
  imageLink: '',
  authors: ["Graham Houser"],
  pubDate: '01-28-2022',
  desc: 'Guide for testing the app.',
}
