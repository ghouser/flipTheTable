# Customizing
Like what you see, but not sure where to jump in?

## Directory Layout
Let's start by looking over the project structure:

```
.
├── /build/                     # The folder for compiled output
├── /node_modules/              # 3rd-party libraries and utilities
├── /public/                    # Static files which are copied into the /build/public folder
├── /src/                       # The source code of the application
│   ├── /components/            # React components

├── Dockerfile                  # Commands for building a Docker image for production

└── yarn.lock                   # Fixed versions of all the dependencies
```

## Components
Module of all react components used to build pages. Add new components or modify existing.

See chakra components for deeper dive.

## Content
Home of all the MDX.
### index.js
Imports all MDX files in subfolders, then exports an object listing its imports.
This creates a list of all files in content, a useful tool in creating dynamic routes.

See `Static Content With MDX` for more information.

## Routes
One folder per route. See `blogPage` and `docsPage` for example of loading MDX files by filename.
### index.js
Primary route declaration.
### src/router.js
Uses [Universal Router](https://github.com/kriasoft/universal-router) npm
module that is built around the same concepts demonstrated earlier with the major differences that
it supports nested routes and provides you with the helper `Link` React component. It can be seen as
a lightweight more flexible alternative to React Router.

- It has simple code with minimum dependencies (just `path-to-regexp` and `babel-runtime`)
- It can be used with any JavaScript framework such as React, Vue.js etc
- It uses the same middleware approach used in Express and Koa, making it easy to learn
- It uses the exact same API and implementation to be used in both Node.js and browser environments

The [Getting Started page](https://github.com/kriasoft/universal-router/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
has a few examples how to use it.

## Back-end - Database
A set of simple user objects are already defined in `data/models/User*`, as well as `sequelize.js` to initialize a simple SQL database to store user logins.
Users are expected to login with Facebook, see `Configure Facebook Login` to better understand the user login flow.

See [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) documentation to better understand ORM.

## Back-end - GraphQL
`data/types` and `data/queries` are to define data that can be returned by GraphQL and the logic to perform the query.

See [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) documentation for more information.

## Environment Variables
Two approaches for environment variables, either set in a config (commits to repo) or local only.
### config.js
Used to set defaults for environment variables
```
src/config.js
```
### Locally Set
Overwrite or add additional environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory.
Varialbes are loaded using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
