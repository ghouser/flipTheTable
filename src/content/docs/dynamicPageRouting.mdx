# Issues with Static Routing
A common modern design principle is DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself. While it is very simple to add a static page by declaring it in a router
, having to do so every time a new blog or document is created requires repetitive code changes that are not truly needed.

Let's examine an approach for making a route to a page that will act as a parent page. It will have a dynamic list of links to sub-pages loaded dynamically.

# List Possible Content
First, it's necessary to create a list of what could be loaded. This example will consider loading MDX files.

## Create File List
To load an MDX file, the name of the file is needed. With an effort to be as DRY as possible, all static content is being stored in the `content` module.

`index.js` for the module uses a wildcard import [babel-plugin-import-glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-import-glob)
which imports everything by the given pattern (in this case *.mdx). The module exports a list of the imports, which is effectively a file list.
The `docs` and `blogs` sub-folders are imported and exported separately, but could have been done in a object.

```jsx
import * as blogs from './blogs/*.mdx';
import * as docs from './docs/*.mdx';
/**
 * Grab the list of blogs and store them in a blog list.
 */
const blogList = Object.keys(blogs);
/**
 * Grab the list of docs and store them in a doc list.
 */
const docList = Object.keys(docs);
// export list of blogs and docs
export { blogList, docList };
```

## Create Friendly Content List
Users will need some friendly formatted information about the content that could be accessed.

As explained in `staticContentWithMDX`, MDX files can have exports, and MDX files in this repo are setup with a `metadata` export.
As the filename is now known, the MDX file can be lazy loaded, and the metadata can be read to display user friendly information about the content.

This repo uses GraphQL query to load all MDX files in a directory, and return an object of each files metadata (`data/queries/fileList.js`):
```jsx
const blogList = {
  type: new List(FileMetadata),
  resolve() {
    const promises = [];
    const results = [];
    return listMDX('blogs').then(blogNames => {
      blogNames.forEach(name => {
        // create an array of promised MDX files
        promises.push(getMDX(`blogs/${name}.mdx`));
      });
      // for each file, get the metadata object and add to results array
      return Promise.all(promises).then(modules => {
        modules.forEach(module => {
          results.push(module.metadata);
        });
        // return results array
        return results;
      });
    });
  },
};
```
Output:
```
"blogList": [
      {
        "title": "Blog 1",
        "imageLink": "cards.jpg",
        "authors": [
          "Graham Houser"
        ],
        "pubDate": "01-01-2021",
        "desc": "Describe Blog 1"
      },
      {
        "title": "Blog 2",
        "imageLink": "dice.jpg",
        "authors": [
          "Graham Houser"
        ],
        "pubDate": "01-01-2021",
        "desc": "Describe blog 2"
      },
      . . .
]
```

# Create Route and Sub Route
The route design pattern will be `/parent` to the parent page, then `parent/child` for the sub-page.
```
/blog
/blog/blogName
```
## Router
The router needs only two routes, one to parent, and another parent/:variable
```
    {
      path: '/blog',
      load: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: 'blog' */ './blog'),
    },
    {
      path: '/blog/:name',
      load: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: 'blogPage' */ './blogPage'),
    },
```

# Create Page and Sub Page
With the content list and route created, the pages can be built out.

## Parent Page
The parent page needs to create a list of possible sub pages. It can call the content list created before, and render elements in any way desired (tiles, accordion, bullet list, etc).

For `blog` in this repo, it maps across the blogList, and creates a tile per blog, each with a link to `blogs/filename`
```jsx
// routes/blog/Blog.js

// create simple key by combining title and date without spaces
function generateKey(title, date) {
  return title.replace(/\s/g, '') + date.replace(/\s/g, '');
}
// blogList is output of graphQL query
export default function Blog({ blogList }) {
  return (
    <Grid
      templateColumns="repeat(2, 1fr)"
      gap={5}
      justifyItems="center"
      p="5px"
    >
      {blogList.map((content, index) => (
        <Flex
          direction="column"
          key={generateKey(content.title, content.pubDate)}
        >
          <Tile tileId={index} content={content} />
          <Text fontFamily="sans-serif" color="blue.700">
            {content.authors} - {content.pubDate}
          </Text>
        </Flex>
      ))}
    </Grid>
  );
}
```

## Child Page
Finally, the child page is a simple lazy loaded MDX page. See `Lazy Loading MDX` for code example.

# Design Considerations
Following the above design, adding a new doc or blog is as simple as adding the .MDX file to the correct `content` path.

The following should be considered when using this approach.
* `content/index.js` needs to be recompiled when a new file is added for the wildcard import to pick it up
  * `yarn rebuild`
* Sub-folders of `content` should be kept to a minimum.
  * Additional grouping and sorting of content and be done through data in the `metadata` export of each MDX file

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Dynamic Page Routing',
  fileName:'dynamicPageRouting',
  imageLink: '',
  authors: ["Graham Houser"],
  pubDate: '01-28-2022',
  desc: 'Guide for creating pages dynamically without static coded routes.',
}
