# Chakra UI
[Chakra Full Docs](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started)

Let's take a look at a few key pieces in this project
## App.js - Top React Component
The top-level React component setting context (global) variables that can be accessed from all the child components.
Unless there is an intention to remove Chakra or MDX, this file will not need any modification.
Chakra `ThemeProvider` is used here.
```
src/components/App.js
```

## Theme.js - Chankra UI Theme
File for configuring the theme used by Chankra UI components. `MDXComponents` maps loaded MDX to Chakra components.
```
src/components/Theme.js
```

A full color palette has already been defined, but can be modified in `CustomTheme`.

## ChakraLink
Custom component, takes a Chakra UI `<LINK>` and adds methods to redirecty internally.
Should be used instead of `<LINK>` for inter-site links.
```
src/components/ChakraLink
```

## MDXPage
Custom component, lazy loads an MDX file out of a content folder or subfolder and returns the JSX content.
```
src/components/MDXPage
```

## FriendlyError
Should be used as the fallback component when using an Error Boundary.
```
src/components/FriendlyError
```
