# Project Intro
Started as a clone of [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/master).
While much of the starter kit is intact, there are a few key modifications:
- CSS Styling and Isomorphic Style Loader replaced by [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- Support for MD files replaced by [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- Additional components to help with MDX files
- Additional components to help jump start modern styling (such as a landing page component)

# Getting Started

## Requirements
- Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux
  - For Windows, recommend WSL2
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package + [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8.16.2 or
  newer
- Text editor setup for React, JSX, Flow, ESlint

### Notable files
#### Chankra UI Theme
File for configuring the theme used by Chankra UI components.
```
src/components/Theme.js
```
#### Chakra Link
Custom component, takes a Chakra UI `<LINK>` and adds methods to redirecty internally.
Should be used instead of `<LINK>` for inter-site links.
```
src/components/ChakraLink
```
#### Friendly Error
Should be used as the fallback component when using an Error Boundary.
```
src/components/FriendlyError
```
#### Server Config
Used to set defaults for environment variables
```
src/config.js
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Project
Clone the latest version
```shell
TO DO: commands to clone
```

### 2. Install
```shell
$ yarn install
```

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](../package.json) file.

### 3. Run in Development
```shell
$ yarn start
```

**Development mode overwrites some environment variables, see `src/config.js`**

This command will build the app from the source files (`/src`) into the output
`/build` folder. As soon as the initial build completes, it will start the
Node.js server (`node build/server.js`) and
[Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) with
[HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement) on top of it.

> [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) — Node.js server
> (`build/server.js`) with Browsersync and HMR enabled\
> [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql) — GraphQL server
> and IDE\
> [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/) — Browsersync control panel
> (UI)

Now you can open your web app in a browser, on mobile devices and start hacking.
Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/src` folder, the module
bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will recompile the app on the fly
and refresh all the connected browsers.

### 4. Run in release
```shell
$ yarn start --release
```

_NOTE: double dashes are required_

This command will run the app in release mode, as it would be seen when fully deployed. The

## Environment Variables
Overwrite or add additional environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory.
Varialbes are loaded using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

## Addtional Tasks - Build, Test, Deploy

If you need just to build the app (without running a dev server), simply run:

```shell
$ yarn run build
```

or, for a production build:

```shell
$ yarn run build --release
```

or, for a production docker build:

```shell
$ yarn run build --release --docker
```

_NOTE: double dashes are required_

After running this command, the `/build` folder will contain the compiled
version of the app. For example, you can launch Node.js server normally by
running `node build/server.js`.

To check the source code for syntax errors and potential issues run:

```shell
$ yarn run lint
```

To launch unit tests:

```shell
$ yarn run test          # Run unit tests with Jest
$ yarn run test-watch    # Launch unit test runner and start watching for changes
```

By default, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test runner is looking for test files
matching the `src/**/*.test.js` pattern. Take a look at
`src/components/Layout/Layout.test.js` as an example.

To deploy the app, run:

```shell
$ yarn run deploy
```

The deployment script `tools/deploy.js` is configured to push the contents of
the `/build` folder to a remote server via Git. You can easily deploy your app
to
[Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/),
or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) this way. Both will execute `yarn install --production` upon receiving new files from you. Note, you should only deploy
the contents of the `/build` folder to a remote server.
