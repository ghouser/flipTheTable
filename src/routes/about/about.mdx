# The Burden of Intelligence

I have created this website because I believe sharing knowledge is a profound human experience.
Why is that my belief? It starts with the Oxford definition for "intelligence". "The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills."

Obviously a simple dictionary definition barely scratches the surface. There is a mountain of psychological thought around the intricacies of intelligence, but there are two common traits that seem to set humans apart. First, we can acquire and apply knowledge and skills without having to experience them first hand. Second, we can use tools (such as language and technology) to pass knowledge and skills to others. In broad terms, human intelligence allows us to create shortcuts, which prevents us from having to reinvent solutions to problems.

For example, I would like to clean my living room, but my vacuum cleaner is clogged. Obviously I will watch a video on how to disassemble my vacuum cleaner, and then go do that. It does not require me to have prior knowledge of vacuum cleaners, nor does it require the physical presence of a vacuum cleaner expert.

While helping me with a chore might not seem world changing, it is easy to see that the past success of mankind has been through leveraging the shortcuts we have created. It also stands to reason that our future will be built on the shortcuts we make today.

I find it very empowering, and almost magical, to think that I could contribute in some way to this human intelligence. Unfortunately, observation and practice are two different things and it is difficult to actually create a meaningful shortcut.

My father often says, "it can be a burden being the smartest person in the room". It sounds pretentious, but what he is describing is how defeating it can be to see patterns and potential solutions around you, but to lack the time, energy, or help to turn those observations into real solutions. The result is being stuck, doing the same exercises over again.
This website is an effort for me to avoid such a burden. An outlet to organize my thoughts and make my knowledge and skills available to others as best I can. I do not have lofty goals to "change the world", but if I want to contribute at all, I must start.
